Hello, I am a second year math graduate student at Colorado State University.

In my past life, I was a [software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cl587/) at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), helping to make education accessible to all.

# Personal

I grew up in the frozen tundra of Calgary, Alberta. Then I worked in Silicon Valley up in the San Francisco Bay Area for 6 years prior to coming to graduate school for mathematics.

Outside of math, I like to drink coffee, play hockey, ski, bike, and run (trail and road). I also enjoy playing and studying poker theory.

# Writing

Most of my writing are not publically available, but throughout the years, some have been published on Coursera's tech blog.

# Presentations

* [Dependent Types with Pie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48lio_3FhAo) - As part of the [Applied Category Theory Seminar](https://www.math.colostate.edu/~jwilson/ACTS.html) at Colorado State University, I presented on the dependent type programming language Pie.
* [Kan Condition for Simplicial Sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYsL8NJKtw) - As part of the ACATs seminar, I presented on how to compute with simplicial sets, a generalization of simplicies, which themselves generalize triangles. In particular, unwrapping the category theoretical definitions and the strong/weak Kan conditions to understand how they provide a useful model for higher categories.
* [ACM/ACM-W at CSU](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~acm/) presentation - I presented to the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and ACM-Women groups at Colorado State University about interviewing for a technical position, drawing on my previous experiences as an interviewer and designer of interviewing questions.

# Teaching

* SP22 - Math 160: Calculus for Physical Scientists I
* FA22 - Math 101: Math in the Social Sciences
