Hello, I am a first year math graduate student at Colorado State University.

In my past life, I was a [software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cl587/) at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), helping to make education accessible to all.

# Personal

I grew up in the frozen tundra of Calgary, Alberta. Then I worked in Silicon Valley up in the San Francisco Bay Area for 6 years prior to coming to graduate school.

Outside of math, I like to drink coffee, play hockey, ski, bike, run. I also enjoy playing and studying poker theory.

# Writing

Most of my writing are not publically available, but throughout the years, some have been published on Coursera's tech blog.
