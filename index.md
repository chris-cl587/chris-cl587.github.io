Hello, I am a fourth year math graduate student at Colorado State University.

In my past life, I was a [software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cl587/) at [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/), helping to make education accessible to all.

# Personal

I grew up in the frozen tundra of Calgary, Alberta. Then I worked in Silicon Valley up in the San Francisco Bay Area for 6 years prior to coming to graduate school for mathematics.

Outside of math, I like to drink coffee, play hockey, ski, bike, and run (trail and road). I also enjoy playing and studying poker theory.

# Writing

Most of my writing are not publically available, but throughout the years, some have been published on Coursera's tech blog.

# Presentations

* [Fast Solutions to Simultaneous Sylvester Systems](https://slides.com/chrisliu/quicksylver-taga24) - As part of the [Tensors Algebra-Geometry-Applications 2024](https://thetensor.space/events/TAGA-2024) conference, I [presented](https://thetensor.space/events/TAGA24-Conference-Resources#chris-liu) on an algorithm for solving tensor equations.

* [Quick solvers for endomorphisms of modules.](https://thetensor.space/events/GNT-2023#chris-liu) - As part of the [Groups, Nilpotence, and Tensors 2023](https://thetensor.space/events/GNT-2023) conference, I presented on ideas to solve Simultaneous Sylvester Systems - systems of matrix equations of the form XA_i + B_iY = C_i.
* [The big tent of functional programming
](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Azr5Cn7AoQ1DVeRxS_56a8qEUIDSt4JtiXUqiTN_eSU/edit#slide=id.p)  - As part of the [Applied Category Theory Seminar](https://csu-applied-category-theory.github.io) at Colorado State University, I presented on the core idea behind functional programming - using types and data flow to program.
* [Option Data Type](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15ujgShfHwgQxYQYe3wx-lozlKmhUAKKmj3b6wMf_hMI/edit#slide=id.p)  - As part of the [Applied Category Theory Seminar](https://csu-applied-category-theory.github.io) at Colorado State University, I presented on the Option data type in Scala, a commonly used monad in functional programming that allows for composing failable operations.
* [Dependent Types with Pie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48lio_3FhAo) - As part of the [Applied Category Theory Seminar](https://csu-applied-category-theory.github.io) at Colorado State University, I presented on the dependent type programming language Pie.
* [Kan Condition for Simplicial Sets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVYsL8NJKtw) - As part of the ACATs seminar, I presented on how to compute with simplicial sets, a generalization of simplicies, which themselves generalize triangles. In particular, unwrapping the category theoretical definitions and the strong/weak Kan conditions to understand how they provide a useful model for higher categories.
* [ACM/ACM-W at CSU](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~acm/) presentation - I presented to the ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) and ACM-Women groups at Colorado State University about interviewing for a technical position, drawing on my previous experiences as an interviewer and designer of interviewing questions.
